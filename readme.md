# Band Site - Sprint 1

Sprint 1 Band Site project from BrainStation Web Dev Bootcamp.  Vancouver Feb 2023.

## Note on Styling

The page was styled to match the mockups at the below widths: 

* Mobile - 320px
* Tablet - 768px
* Desktop - 1280px

Specific styling choice:
* Title in the Hero Banner - I matched the mockup at 320p, but then scaled this title/header up continuously until it hit the tablet breakpoint.  It just looks better to have it scaling up at the lower viewport sizes.
* Hero Banner - Again, it scales up in size continously then hits a maximum height at a certain point as otherwise it would look too huge and push content below the fold after a certain point.
* Content Area width - I limited the max width of the content area to 1735px so that it would remain readable on super wide screens.  Some of the background elements/colors continue to extend with the screen though.
